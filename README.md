## Codespaces
This repository relies on GitHub codespaces as a way to run the code that you write.
We will not be using all the features of codespaces, just writing code in the editor,
navigating through different files, and running our code from the terminal.

### Start codespaces
To start a new codespace clikc the green "<> Code" button in the top right and then
click the "+" under the codespaces tab.
