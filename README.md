# educ485-multimedia-project
Demonstration of using GitHub as a education platform for learning Zig.

## Codespaces
This repository relies on GitHub codespaces as a way to run the code that you write.
We will not be using all the features of codespaces, just writing code in the editor,
navigating through different files, and running our code from the terminal.

### Start codespaces
To start a new codespace click the green "<> Code" button in the top right and then
click the "+" under the codespaces tab.

### The editor
Once the codespace has started, the majority of the screen is taken up by the editor.
There are tabs at the top for all of your open files and you can switch between them.
The text editor should work exactly as you expect. Use your cursor to navigate to where
you want to edit and use your keyboard to edit the file.

An example of the editor window:

### The terminal
At the bottom of the page is the terminal. This is where you will run and test your code.
More details on how to do that are covered in the lessons themselves.

An example of the terminal:

### Navigation
On the left hand side of the codespace is the explorer. This is where you will see the folder
structure of the repository. You can open each folder to see each of the lessons contained within
the module. You can then click on the file that represents a lesson to open it in the editor. There
will be comments in the lesson teaching you about Zig and what to do during the lesson.
